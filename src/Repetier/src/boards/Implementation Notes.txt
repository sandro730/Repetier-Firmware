# Implementation Notes

This document contains important information on HAL related topics. Intention isto help understand 
why some things are implemented the way they are.


## Timer priorities

Order of timer priority if possible:

0 Motion3 timer highest priority
1 Serial communication second highest priority so we loose no data
2 Beeper for good quality but not blocking critical interrupts
3 Servos are quite fast and need precision or the jitter, so higher then motion2
4 Motion2 needs frequent calls also not that sensitive due to caching of buffers.
5 PWM is not that relevant - it's only software pwm and can be slow.

For arm based system these are the priorities that should be set.
