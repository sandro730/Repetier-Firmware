Any special Repetier Firmware V2 specific changes made to the SdFat library:

-11/10/20:
    - added variant of open to FsFile/FatFile/ExFatFile: 
    open(FsVolume* vol, uint32_t index, oflag_t oflag) 
    to open by dirIndexes using only a volume pointer.
    - Lowered SdCardInfo.h's SD_INIT_TIMEOUT from 2 seconds
    to 1500ms.

-11/25/20: 
    - Replaced the digitalRead/Write functions with digitalWriteFast's inside DigitalPin.h for STM32F1 boards and STM32Duino.
    (And also SdSpiChipSelect.cpp's.)

-11/26/20: 
    - added getVolumeLabel to FAT16/32 to easily obtain the mbr's label.
    (label saved in FatPartition.h at first init.) 
    - supported through FSVolume, though not for exFat yet (returns nothing).
