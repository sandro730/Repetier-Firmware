/*
Here you can override the dummy events defined in Events.h
That way you should not need to modify the fimrware it self to add
your new functionality.

Also check customMacros.h where you can add your own modules!

All files in this folder are dummy files in the native firmware. shouldon updates you just 
replace these files with your version. There will be no need to
always check all files for changes to update.
